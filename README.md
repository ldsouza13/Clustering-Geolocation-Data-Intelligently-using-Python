# Clustering-Geolocation-Data-Intelligently-using-Python
Used various clustering methods like K-means, DBSCAN, HDBSCAN and a hybrid approach to define key clusters of taxi rank locations, where we can build service stations for all taxis operating in that region.<br>

The various tasks included in this project include:<br>
- Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis<br>
- Task 2: Visualizing Geographical Data<br>
- Task 3: Clustering Strength / Performance Metric<br>
- Task 4: K-Means Clustering<br>
- Task 5: DBSCAN<br>
- Task 6: HDBSCAN<br>
- Task 7: Addressing Outliers<br>

Technology used: Python3, NumPy, Matplotlib, sklearn, Pandas, Folium
